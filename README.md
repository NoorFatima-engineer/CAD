In this project, we utilized FreeCAD to create an assembly of components capable of transforming linear motion into rotational motion. The assemblies were designed using the A2plus Workbench, enabling us to connect and constrain individual parts effectively. The project involved the following components: Stand, Wheel, Cylinder, Piston, and Pin.

Workbenches Used:
Part Design Workbench:
Used for designing complex solid parts essential for manufacturing and assembling.
A2plus Workbench:
Enabled part assembly by adding constraints, such as axis coincident, plane parallel, and plane coincident.

Key Features:
Component Design: Each part was meticulously created using sketching, padding, pocketing, and filleting tools.
Assembly Process: Constraints were applied systematically to ensure proper alignment and functionality.
Animation: Interactive animations were implemented using the dragging feature to simulate the transformation of motion.
This project demonstrates a practical application of CAD software for mechanical systems, emphasizing design precision, assembly techniques, and motion simulation.
